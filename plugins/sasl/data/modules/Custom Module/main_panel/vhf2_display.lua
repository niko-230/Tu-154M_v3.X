-- exclusive via the existing kontur_on v1/v2 gating in tu154_cockpit.obj.

-- VHF1's screen uses ATTR_cockpit (X-Plane's native 2D panel texture), which
-- runs through X-Plane's own lighting/exposure engine and naturally brightens
-- in daylight and dims at night. VHF2 uses ATTR_cockpit_device (a SASL avionics
-- screen), where brightnessCallback is the ONLY thing controlling brightness --
-- a flat constant here means VHF2 never responds to lighting at all, which is
-- why it read dark vs VHF1 in daylight and bright vs VHF1 at night. Tying this
-- to sun angle as a day/night proxy so it tracks the same general direction as
-- VHF1's real lighting response, even though the underlying mechanism differs.
